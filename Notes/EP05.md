<------- LETS GET HOOKED ------>

1. Separate files for each component

2. import and export of file(Two types)
   i. default export/import => export default Header
                               import "component name" from "path"
   ii. named export/import => used when we need to export multiple things from same file.
                              export LOGO_URL = "......"
                              import {"component name"} from "path"

3. HOOKS ==>> 
  -> Hooks are JS functions given to us by react.
  -> hooks are prebuilt.
  Two imp hooks are:
  a. useState()
  b. useEffect()

4. useState()=>
   -> import useState()
      import { useState } from "react
   -> create state variable
      const [listOfRestaurants, setlistOfRestaurants] = useState([|])
                                                                  |
                                                                  default value is passed
   -> setlistOfRestaurants is a function and use to modify the listOfRestaurants
                    setlistOfRestaurants(filteredList);

NOTE ::=> When a state variable is changed react will rerenders the component.

5. Reconciliation algorithm (React fiber) ==>>
   ->virtual Dom => is a representation of actual DOM. Virtual DOM is actually a object representation of actual DOM.
   -> Diff algorithm => finds out the diff b/w two virtual DOMs and then ui is updated accordingly.

NOTE::=> React is fast b/c DOM manipulation is fast in react.
