<- **** TALK IS CHEAP, SHOW ME CODE ****** ->

1. Firstly plan your project structure.
   /**
 * Header
 *   Logo
 *   nav items
 * Body
 *    search
 *    restaurant container
 *       restaurant card
 *          img, name of res, star rating, cuisine, delivery time
 * Footer
 *   copyright
 *   inks
 *   address
 *   contact
 */

2. Props in react ==>> 
   -> When we have to dynamically pass some data to a component, we pass using props.
   -> At the end as components are JS functions similarly props are arguments to a function.
   -> props are objects.
   i. Passing props=>
       <RestaurantCard 
         resName = "Meghana Foods",
         cuisines = "Biryani, Asian, North Indian
        />
    ii. Using/ Receiving props=>
       a. const RestaurantCard = (props) =>{
            <h3>{props.resName}</h3>
            <h3>{props.cuisines}</h3>
          }
        b. by destructuring during fly
           const RestaurantCard = ({resName, cuisines}) =>{
            <h3>{resName}</h3>
            <h3>{cuisines}</h3>
           }
        c. const RestaurantCard = (props) =>{
            const {resName, cuisines} = props;
            <h3>{resName}</h3>
            <h3>{cuisines}</h3>
        }

3. Tackling the real data =>
   -> const RestaurantCard = (props) =>{
        const {resData} = props;
        <h3>{resData.data.name}</h3>
        <h3>{resData.data.cuisines}</h3>
     }
           ||
      const RestaurantCard = (props) =>{
        const resData = {props}
        const {
            name, 
            cuisines, 
            deliveryTime
        } = resData?.data
      }
       Now we can directly write as:
         <h3>{name}</h3>
         <h3>{cuisines}</h3>

    -> Looping on the data for all restaurants=>
       {resList.map((restaurant) => (<RestaurantCard
          resData = {restaurant}>
        ))}

4. NOTE::==>>
   i. To give commas(',') between the array data passed as props
       <h3>{resData.data.cuisines.join(" , ")}</h3>
   ii. <h4>{resData.data.costForTwo/100} For Two</h4>
   iii. src = {"https://..........." + resData.data.cloudImageId};
   
5. Use of key while looping over data =>

   {resList.map((restaurant) => (<RestaurantCard
        key = {restaurant.data.id} resData = {restaurant}>
        ))}
    
    i). Need ?? => Because by the help of key React can identify different components separately as a result when   a new component of same type is introduced then React will only render the newly introduced component and      not all the components.
    ii). If key is not passed then all the components are rerendered every time new component is introduced.
    iii). Index can we used as key but not recommended

    not using keys    <<<<< using index as key <<<<<<< using unique id as key
    (not acceptable)        (not recommended)            (best practice)
